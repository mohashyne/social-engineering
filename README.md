•INFRASTRUCTURE PREPARATION: Systems to transport email, song responses and activity, and host content material are deployed and configured.

•CAMPAIGN PREPARATION: Target lists are grouped and sequenced, campaign batches are configured and scheduled, and related training tasks are executed.

•CAMPAIGN LAUNCH: Initial check messages are issued to gauge response behavior, perceive technical controls that may warrant revising the planned approach, and fine-tune assault strategies.

•INITIAL EXPLOITS: As sessions are established, initial exploits are pursued to establish a baseline get admission via payloads, command and control, scripted actions, identify secondary targets on the compromised network, and establish persistence

•SECONDARY EXPLOITS: Attempts to expand a presence throughout the connected environment with the aid of bypassing a person to get admission to controls, figuring out inside weaknesses to exploit, leveraging immoderate person rights, and compromising linked structures.
